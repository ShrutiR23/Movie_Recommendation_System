# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System

This project is a **Movie Recommendation System** that uses machine learning to deliver personalized movie suggestions. It applies **vectorization (TF-IDF)** for content-based filtering and features a clean **Streamlit** web interface for user interaction.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

- **Personalization**: Recommend movies tailored to individual preferences.
- **Accuracy**: Analyze genres, keywords, cast, and user history.
- **Diversity**: Include a wide range of movies across cultures and genres.
- **Vectorization**: Use TF-IDF and cosine similarity for feature comparison.
- **Engagement**: Enable interactivity through a Streamlit web app.
- **Scalability**: Handle large datasets like TMDB 5000+ movies.
